    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test is the underlying assumption about the population variance. A z-test assumes that the population variance is known, while a t-test assumes that the population variance is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scenario where a z-test would be appropriate is when the population variance is known, such as when the population follows a normal distribution and the variance is specified in advance. For example, a researcher may want to test whether the mean height of a population is significantly different from a known value, such as the average height of the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a t-test would be appropriate when the population variance is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data. For example, a researcher may want to test whether a new medication reduces blood pressure compared to a placebo. In this case, the population variance is not known and must be estimated from the sample data, so a t-test would be more appropriate.\n",

    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, a one-tailed test is a statistical test in which the null hypothesis is rejected only if the test statistic falls into one side of the distribution. Specifically, a one-tailed test is used when the researcher has a specific prediction or hypothesis about the direction of the effect, either an increase or a decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a two-tailed test is a statistical test in which the null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic falls in either tail of the distribution. A two-tailed test is used when the researcher does not have a specific prediction about the direction of the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a researcher wants to test whether a new drug has an effect on blood pressure. If the researcher predicts that the drug will decrease blood pressure, they would use a one-tailed test with the alternative hypothesis being that the drug has a statistically significant negative effect on blood pressure. On the other hand, if the researcher simply wants to determine whether the drug has any effect on blood pressure, they would use a two-tailed test.\n",

    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, Type 1 and Type 2 errors are the two types of errors that can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error is when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This is also known as a false positive. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α), which is the level of significance set by the researcher. A lower level of significance (i.e., a smaller alpha value) reduces the probability of making a Type 1 error.\n",

    "Example scenario: A company wants to test if a new drug is effective in curing a particular disease. The null hypothesis is that the drug is not effective, but the company incorrectly rejects this null hypothesis and concludes that the drug is effective, leading to widespread use of the drug. Later, it is discovered that the drug has harmful side effects, and it is recalled. This is an example of a Type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error is when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. This is also known as a false negative. The probability of making a Type 2 error is denoted by beta (β). A higher power of the test (i.e., a smaller beta value) reduces the probability of making a Type 2 error.\n",

    "Example scenario: A company wants to test if a new drug is effective in curing a particular disease. The null hypothesis is that the drug is not effective, but the company fails to reject this null hypothesis and concludes that the drug is not effective, leading to the rejection of a potentially useful drug.

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The theorem provides a way to revise existing beliefs or probabilities based on new information or evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes's theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) is the probability of A given B\n",
    "P(B|A) is the probability of B given A\n",
    "P(A) is the prior probability of A\n",
    "P(B) is the prior probability of B\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a hospital has a test to determine if a patient has a particular disease. The test is 90% accurate, which means that if a patient has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as having the disease 90% of the time, and if a patient does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as not having the disease 90% of the time. Suppose the prevalence of the disease in the population is 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say a patient tests positive for the disease. What is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) / P(Positive)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) is the probability of the patient having the disease given that they tested positive\n",
    "P(Positive|Disease) is the probability of testing positive given that the patient has the disease, which is 0.9\n",
    "P(Disease) is the prior probability of the patient having the disease, which is 0.01\n",
    "P(Positive) is the probability of testing positive, which can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "P(Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive|No disease) * P(No disease)\n",
    "P(Positive) = 0.9 * 0.01 + 0.1 * 0.99\n",
    "P(Positive) = 0.108\n",
    "Substituting the values into the formula, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = 0.9 * 0.01 / 0.108\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = 0.083\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that the patient actually has the disease, given that they tested positive, is only 8.3%. This is a classic example of the importance of considering both the accuracy of a test and the prevalence of a condition when interpreting test results.\n",

    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. In other words, it is an estimate of the range of values that a population parameter can take based on a sample from that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the confidence interval, you need to specify the level of confidence (usually expressed as a percentage) and the sample statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample size). The formula for calculating the confidence interval for the population mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence interval = sample mean ± margin of error\n",
    "\n",
    "where the margin of error is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error = critical value x (standard deviation / square root of sample size)\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value is based on the level of confidence and the degrees of freedom (n-1) and can be looked up in a t-distribution table or a z-distribution table depending on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to estimate the average weight of adult men in a city with 95% confidence. We take a random sample of 50 men and find that the sample mean weight is 180 pounds with a standard deviation of 10 pounds. We can calculate the confidence interval as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error = 1.96 x (10 / sqrt(50)) = 2.78\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence interval = 180 ± 2.78 = (177.22, 182.78)\n",

    "Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the\n",
    "event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.\n",
    "Suppose a blood test for a rare disease is 95% accurate, meaning it correctly identifies someone with the disease 95% of the time and correctly identifies someone without the disease 95% of the time. The prevalence of the disease in the population is 0.1%. If someone tests positive for the disease, what is the probability they actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that someone has the disease given that they tested positive. Let D be the event that someone has the disease, and + be the event that they test positive. Then we want to calculate P(D | +), the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from the problem statement that P(D) = 0.001, the prevalence of the disease in the population, and P(¬D) = 0.999, the complement of the disease event. We also know from the problem statement that the sensitivity of the test is 0.95, meaning P(+|D) = 0.95, and the specificity of the test is 0.95, meaning P(¬|¬D) = 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' theorem, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D | +) = P(+ | D) * P(D) / P(+)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate P(+), the probability of testing positive, we use the law of total probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(+) = P(+ | D) * P(D) + P(+ | ¬D) * P(¬D)\n",
    "= 0.95 * 0.001 + 0.05 * 0.999\n",
    "= 0.0509\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting into the original equation, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(D | +) = 0.95 * 0.001 / 0.0509\n",
    "= 0.0187\n",
    "\n",
    "So the probability of someone actually having the disease given a positive test result is only about 1.87%.

    "\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, we need to use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = X ± Z * (σ/√n)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score for the desired level of confidence (in this case, 1.96 for 95% confidence), σ is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n",

    "Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error?\n",
    "Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error in a confidence interval is a measure of how much the sample mean could differ from the true population mean. It is usually represented as a range of values above and below the sample mean. A larger margin of error means that there is greater uncertainty in the estimate of the population mean, while a smaller margin of error means that the estimate is more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size has a direct effect on the margin of error: as the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, and as the sample size decreases, the margin of error increases. This is because larger sample sizes provide more information about the population, leading to more precise estimates of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to estimate the average height of students in a school. We take a sample of 50 students and find that the sample mean height is 65 inches with a margin of error of 3 inches. If we increase the sample size to 100, the margin of error will decrease to 2.12 inches, making our estimate more precise. Similarly, if we decrease the sample size to 25, the margin of error will increase to 4.24 inches, making our estimate less precise.\n",
